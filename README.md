# GABNAI273_FTO2306_GroupA2_GabrielleNaidoo_IWA-19-Final-Capstone
ðŸ“š Web App audited as part of final assessment for first JS module of CodeSpace Academy- done by Gabrielle Naidoo.

Project Description:
A Web App that allows users to search for books by specific authors, titles, or genres.
It serves as a simple and easy-to-use way for a user to find books according to their preferences. It saves a lot of time that would otherwise be wasted on searching through books to find the right author, genre, or title, and allows users to view a brief description of a book so that they can decide whether they like it or not. 

Instructions:
In order to benefit from the code that I have written, you can click on the green button("<>Code") in this repository and download the zip file. You can then extract it and create a local folder on your computer to store the files. Open the files in a code editor, such as VS code to view and edit the contents of your copy of the files. You can use VS Code's "live-server" extension to view the result of the code in a live server. 

Features:
This project is a Wep App called Book Connect that allows a user to search through a list of books and filter it by author name, genre, or book title.
The user is able to switch between light and dark mode according to their preference. They can also view a matching preview with a short description when they click on any of the books.
This project was built using JS variables,for and for...of loops, arrays, objects, and events.

Technologies used: 
JavaScript, VS Code, Git, and GitHub.
